- Finally it's winter, and you know what that means!
- It's time for winter sports!
- And who better to show you the ropes than me, Cir
- AGH

- What is that?
- A giant snowball? 
- I'd better break it before it hurts someone!

- Now you've done it!
- Not only did you steal my spotlight, you also destroyed the nice snowball I was rolling in.
- You did that on purpose?
- N-no, but that's beside the point!
- Prepare to face the wrath of the strongest fairy!
